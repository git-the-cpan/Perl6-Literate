Literate Perl 6.

This project is not under heavy development, and was mostly created as
an experiment with this blog post: <http://use.perl.org/~masak/journal/39568>

If you're after a full-featured Perl environment for literate
programming, have a look at <http://github.com/unixtechie/Literate-Molly>
which already has many more features than this project will ever have. :)
