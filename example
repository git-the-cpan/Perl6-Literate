This is ordinary text. It will be turned into a comment by the literate
Perl 6 preprocessor. This paragraph is followed by a paragraph of code,
which begins with a '>' character. I have a space after the '>', because
I think it's nice. It's not a necessity, though.

There are empty lines before and after the lines of code starting with
'>'. If those empty lines were to be removed, the preprocessor will flag
an error and not produce any output. According to HaskellWiki, "the idea
behind this restriction is capturing the mistake of not inserting the >
mark at the beginning of the line. In general this is not only good
practice, but also a formatting that makes the code more readable."
